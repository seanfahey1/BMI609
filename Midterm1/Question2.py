Assemble the above genome using the same k-mer size using
    (a) velvet (https://github.com/dzerbino/velvetLinks to an external site.)
    (b) megahit (https://github.com/voutcn/megahitLinks to an external site.)
    (c) unicycler (https://github.com/rrwick/UnicyclerLinks to an external site.)
    (d) masurca (https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurcaLinks to an external site.)

Then compare the final assemblies with respect to the H3N2 reference genome using QUAST. Discuss the assemblies with
respect to the 3C criteria (completeness, contiguity, and correctness) - once again, note that you will not receive
any points if you don't discuss your results (50 points).

Please also submit your QUAST output (as .html file) with your answers.
